R and bash scripts for processing NGS data sets customized for the computer system at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen
 
* AMPLICON: scripts for amplicon sequence data

* META_G_T: scripts for shotgun sequencing data (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics) to be executed on unix (master script: metaG-T_master.txt)

* Plotting: several scripts (mostly R functions) for plotting NGS data

* Silvangs_output: R scripts to work with silvangs output (please read README!)

:warning: not all scripts have been thoroughly tested yet. Please let me know, if you run into problems

:warning: Since I moved with my bioinformatic analyses to ZMT, some of the code in this repo is not actively maintained anymore. Please refer to https://gitlab.leibniz-zmt.de/chh/bioinf for newer versions.
