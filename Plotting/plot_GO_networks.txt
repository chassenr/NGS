### step 0: setting up environment
# add owltools to your PATH, e.g.:

module load owltools


### step 1: create list of GO terms as input
# use e.g. R to retrieve the 20 most abundant GO terms in your dataset
# the input for the following steps is a simple text file with one GO term per line
INPUT="ontofox.terms"


### step 2: retrieve all intermediate nodes using the online tool ontofox
# format list of GO terms for ontofox
# create purl for GO terms

sed -e 's/:/_/' -e 's/^/http:\/\/purl\.obolibrary\.org\/obo\//' ${TERMS_IN} > ${TERMS_IN}".purl"

# create ontofox input file by adding header (output URI, source ontology) and tail (top level terms, search strategy)
# head and tail of ontofox file provided in NGS/plotting

cat ontofox_head.txt ${TERMS_IN}".purl" ontofox_tail.txt > ${TERMS_IN}".ontofox_input.txt"

# submit to ontofox (http://ontofox.hegroup.org/)
# set variable for file base of ontofox output file (.owl)

OUTPUT="ontofox_out"


### step 3: reformat ontofox output to xgmml (Cytoscape-compatible format)
# convert owl to xgmml

owltools ${OUTPUT}".owl" --write-xgmml ${OUTPUT}".xgmml"

# Cytoscape will not understand some of the attributes in the xgmml file
# replace name of 'label' attribute with 'altlabel' (Cytoscape will read 'node label')
# replace 'node id' and 'edge id' with 'node label' and 'edge label' (Cytoscape doesn't understand 'id')
# replace '_' in GO term name with ':'
# optional: rename network (2nd line of file: graph id="GO_net" altlabel="GO_net_test")

sed -e 's/label/altlabel/' -e 's/node id/node label/' -e 's/edge id/edge label/' -e 's/GO_/GO:/g' ${OUTPUT}".xgmml" >  ${OUTPUT}".reformat.xgmml"


### step 4: extract GO terms from network file and get abundance information
# search for purls of GO terms
# extract GO term from purl
# replace '_' in GO term name with ':'

grep -F '<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_' ${OUTPUT}".owl" | sed -e 's/    <owl:Class rdf:about="http:\/\/purl\.obolibrary\.org\/obo\///' -e 's/">//' -e 's/_/:/' > ${OUTPUT}".terms"


### step 5: plot network (${OUTPUT}".reformat.xgmml") in Cytoscape or R, etc.
# create node attributes file in e.g. R, containing information on:
#   top level GO terms (molecular function, biological process, cellular component)
#   abundance of all GO terms in network
# this information is part of the output of the PostR.R script of the metaG-T workflow
# Change network layout e.g. by selecting node color by top level GO terms and node size and transparency by abundance of GO terms
