# Analysis of 16S amplicons 

# Based on a script adpated from the OSD 16S pipeline (https://colab.mpi-bremen.de/micro-b3/svn/analysis-scripts/trunk/osd-analysis/osd-pre-processing/16S/lgc/primer-clipping/02primer-clipping.sh author: Antonio Fernandez-Guerra) by Christiane Hassenrueck at the MPI Bremen. Swarming and (some of) the classification (additional credits: Chris Quast, Josephine Rapp, Pier Buttigieg) differs from the OSD pipeline.
# reads generated on a MiSeq, 2x300bp
# customized for sequencing at CeBiTec in Bielefeld (Halina Tegetmeyer)
# input seqeunces do NOT contain barcode and adapter sequences anymore, but still contain primer sequences
# to avoid weird line endings (^M) work exclusively on linux when preparing and creating files (or make sure you convert to Linux line endings)
# workflow optimzed for parallelization on the SGE cluster of the MPI Bremen

###step 0: shorten file names, rename to running number

#moving original files to separate directory
mkdir Original
mv *.fastq ./Original/

#creating directory for renamed files
mkdir Renamed

#save original file names
ls -1v ./Original/*R1.fastq > ./Renamed/originalR1
ls -1v ./Original/*R2.fastq > ./Renamed/originalR2

#copy original files to new file names
new=1
for i in $(ls -1v ./Original/*R1.fastq)
do
  cp ${i} ./Renamed/${new}"_R1.fastq"
  ((new++))
done

new=1
for i in $(ls -1v ./Original/*R2.fastq)
do
  cp ${i} ./Renamed/${new}"_R2.fastq"
  ((new++))
done

#check that the renaming was done correctly
ls -1v ./Renamed/[0-9]*_R1.fastq > ./Renamed/renamedR1
ls -1v ./Renamed/[0-9]*_R2.fastq > ./Renamed/renamedR2

paste ./Renamed/originalR1 ./Renamed/renamedR1 > ./Renamed/fileID_R1

###step 1: primer clipping 
# (adapted from https://colab.mpi-bremen.de/micro-b3/svn/analysis-scripts/trunk/osd-analysis/osd-pre-processing/16S/lgc/primer-clipping/02primer-clipping.sh)

# for each sample the following commands will remove the primer sequence when found (or discard the read)
# it will search both R1 and R2 for both the forward and the reverse primer sequence and
# if the insert is inverted, it will turn the sequences in the right orientation to make life easier downstream...

# Input your primer sequences, use ^ to anchor to the beginning of line
FBC=^CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG # forward primer
RBC=^GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC # reverse primer

OFWD=16 # length of forward primer (17) - 1
OREV=20 # length of reverse primer (21) - 1

# Set the proportion of mismatches allowed when matching the primer sequences
ERROR=0.16

#create directory for output of primer clipping
mkdir Clipped

#primer clipping on SGE cluster
qsub -t 1-${NSAMPLE} -v CUTADAPT=${CUTADAPT},FBC=${FBC},RBC=${RBC},OFWD=${OFWD},OREV=${OREV},ERROR=${ERROR} ${CLIP_qsub}

#cleaning up directories
mkdir ./Clipped/Clipped_logs
mv ${CLIP_qsub}.* ./Clipped/Clipped_logs/
mv ./Clipped/*.log ./Clipped/Clipped_logs/
mv ./Clipped/*.info ./Clipped/Clipped_logs/


###step 2: quality trimming 
# for long inserts (450ish and onwards) recommended after merging 
# (you need all the bases you can get, additionally two identical bases with low quality which are merged will generally have a higher quality score.
# shorter inserts have more overlap and can afford some loss)
# for the standard bacterial illumina insert we can do it before merging

# ptrim = identical sequence headers with R1 and R2 strim = single output, complementary reads removed
# SLIDINGWINDOW:4:10 is the absolute minimum! 4:15 recommended
# argument order matters! MINLEN should come after trimming.

# for each sample, trim the clipped reads with a sliding window of 4 and a quality threshold of 15
# Discard reads less than 100 bps.

#creating directory for output of quality trimming
mkdir Trimmed

qsub -t 1-${NSAMPLE} -v TRIMMOMATIC=${TRIMMOMATIC} ${TRIM_qsub}

#cleaning up directories
mkdir ./Trimmed/Trimmed_logs
mv ${TRIM_qsub}.* ./Trimmed/Trimmed_logs
mv ./Trimmed/*.log ./Trimmed/Trimmed_logs


###step 3: read merging (CHECK RESOURCES!!!)
# this will merge reads with a minimum overlap of 10 (-v)
# the minimum length of the merged reads is 350 (-n)
# for short insert sizes it might be recommented to set a maximum length for the merged reads (-m). 
# Freakishly long reads generally indicate an error...

# j: threads
# v: overlap
# n: min insert length
# m: max insert length (expect 420)
# o: output just needs basename, other stuff is added by PEAR
# no trimming (q) enabled as trimmomatic did the work here.

#creating directory for output of merging
mkdir Merged

qsub -t 1-${NSAMPLE} -v PEAR=${PEAR} ${PEAR_qsub}

#cleaning up directories

###step 4: quality control with FASTQC

#create directory for fastqc output

qsub -t 1-${NSAMPLE} -v FASTQC=${FASTQC} ${FASTQC_qsub}

#cleaning up directories
mkdir ./FastQC/FastQC_logs
mv ${FASTQC_qsub}.* ./FastQC/FastQC_logs

# Some of the quality scoring done by FASTQC results in inappropriate WARN/FAIL statuses:
# summary stats other than the mean are set to 0, probably due to a lack of sequence
# representation. Thus the following code will parse through the fastqc output re-assign PASS/WARN/FAIL statuses
# based on per base sequence quality...

for i in $(seq 1 ${NSAMPLE})
do

  # pull out the section of the fastqc output
  awk '/^>>Per base sequence quality/,/^>>END_MODULE/' ./FastQC/$i".assembled_fastqc"/fastqc_data.txt | grep "^[0-9]"> ./FastQC/$i".assembled_fastqc"/fastqc_PBSQ.txt

  # check if the number of bins with a median quality value (column 3, $3 in awk) not equal to zero is equal
  # to the number of bins with a median qual of at least 15 and a 10th percentile (column 6, $6 in awk) of at
  # least quality 5.
  # if that's true, check if the quality has a median qual of 25 and 10th perc of at least 10 - assign PASS
  # else WARN 
  # else FAIL
  # Based on these results, modify the per base seq qual (row 2) of the summary.txt file and capture
  # the results in a new summary file: summary1.txt.

###step 5: swarm OTU clustering (https://github.com/torognes/swarm)
